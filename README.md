In IE226.

## Abstraction

Evangelion series can be considered as pieces of media that changed me and somehow helped me through tough times in my life. Even if I change, grow older, and become more mature, I still carry a piece of it years after watching it. Having learned about computer visualization, I get the chance to model myself some of the aesthetic objects from my most beloved anime mentioned above. Specifically, Gendo's glasses, a coffee mug, cigarettes, and ashtray will be illustrated under the scenario of The End of Evangelion.
